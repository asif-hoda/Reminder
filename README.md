# Reminder
Simple Python script for a reminder program

To run the file, simply open Linux based terminal and run the file. If you want to stop the file simply press - 'CTRL + Z'. This will keep the file running in the background till you do not close the terminal. Simply type - 'bg' to show the process of this file. You just donot have to close the terminal.
If anyone knows a better method then please tell me in the Issues section.
